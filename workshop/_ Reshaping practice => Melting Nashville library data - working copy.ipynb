    "# Melting Nashville library data\n",
    "\n",
    "One reshaping task that comes up frequently is \"melting\" or \"unpivoting\" data -- turning \"long\" data into something that's tidier and easier to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of data that needs melting is the city of Nashville's [\"Public Library Visits By Branch\"](https://data.nashville.gov/Libraries/Nashville-Public-Library-Visits-by-Branch/3iet-ewuy) database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The header row looks like this: `Month,Year,Bellevue Library,Bordeaux Library,Donelson Library,East Library,Edgehill Library,Edmonson Pike Library,Goodlettsville Library,Green Hills Library,Hadley Park Library,Hermitage Library,Inglewood Library,Looby Library,Madison Library,Main Library,North Library,Old Hickory Library,Pruitt Library,Richland Park Library,Southeast Library,Thompson Lane Library,Watkins Library,Notes\n",
    "`. Each row has multiple observations, one for each branch in the library system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It'd be a lot easier to analyze if the data looked more like this: `Month,Year,Library,Count`. This is sometimes called [\"tidy data,\"](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) where each row represents _one_ observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tidy up this untidy data, we're going to use a pandas method called [`melt()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.melt.html), which will take each column of library data and \"melt\" it into a new row. We just need to tell it which ones are the \"identifying\" columns (month, year and notes) and which are the \"value\" columns we want to melt. We'll also specify the names of the new columns that are created, but that step is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing pandas."
