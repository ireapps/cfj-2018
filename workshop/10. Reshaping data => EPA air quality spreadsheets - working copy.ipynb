    "# Reshaping data: EPA air quality spreadsheets\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my favorite tasks for Python is reshaping data -- taking data that's spread across dozens or hundreds of identically formatted worksheets or even separate spreadsheets, say, and pulling it all into a nice, clean CSV. Or taking a jankily formatted data set and tidying it up. Pandas has a number of tools and strategies for reshaping data [that you can read about here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reshaping.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to do something a little more bespoke. We've got a spreadsheet of EPA air quality data for core-based statistical areas in Ohio ([thanks, Becca!](https://twitter.com/_becca_king_)). The spreadsheet has a few dozen worksheets, one for each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our mission: Turn it into a single CSV with nice, flat data, and the year appended to each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "So right now, the headers on each sheet look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`CBSA Code\tCBSA\tCO 2nd Max 1-hr\tCO 2nd Max 8-hr\tNO2 98th Percentile 1-hr\tNO2 Mean 1-hr\tOzone 2nd Max 1-hr\tOzone 4th Max 8-hr\tSO2 99th Percentile 1-hr\tSO2 2nd Max 24-hr\tSO2 Mean 1-hr\tPM2.5 98th Percentile 24-hr\tPM2.5 Weighted Mean 24-hr\tPM10 2nd Max 24-hr\tPM10 Mean 24-hr\tLead Max 3-Mo Avg`\n",
    "\n",
    "In our CSV, the headers will be the same but with a `year` column added.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a way to do this whole thing in pandas, I'm pretty sure, but I like [`openpyxl`](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/) for this task, so that's what we'll use.\n",
