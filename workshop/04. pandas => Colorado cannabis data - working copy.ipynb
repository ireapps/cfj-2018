    "# Colorado cannabis data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to look at some county-level data on retail and medical cannabis sales in Colorado. [The data are](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-sales-reports) updated every month by the Colorado Department of Revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cannabis sales data lives here: `../data/co-cannabis-sales.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to note about this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every row in our data is the sum of one month of sales for one category of cannabis (\"retail\" or \"medical\") for one county\n",
    "- Not every county in Colorado has pot shops\n",
    "- Not every county in Colorado has _retail_ pot shops\n",
    "- To maintain taxpayer privacy, the state releases aggregate sales data only for counties with at least three dispensaries, and then only if none represent more than 80 percent of total sales, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue. Totals for counties that don't meet these criteria are represented in the data as 'NR'\n",
    "- One of the \"counties\" in the data is \"Sum of NR Counties\" -- the weed sales from all of the \"NR\" counties grouped together for that month -- which is how everything totals up like it should\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have a CSV of Colorado county population estimates for 2016: `../data/co-county-pop.csv`. We'll use this to help us answer a question about per-capita sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load up our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll import pandas. Then we'll tell pandas to change the way it displays floating-point numbers (decimals, basically) so that we won't have to look at big numbers in scientific notation later on (gross, no thanks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we'll use the `read_csv()` method to create dataframes for each CSV as we need them."
