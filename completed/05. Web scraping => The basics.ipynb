    "# Web scraping 101\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of fetching and parsing unstructured or semistructured data from the web, adding structure and (often) saving to a local file for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping is all about finding the patterns in the information displayed on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scraping can be brittle and error-prone -- it should be your last resort\n",
    "    - Ask for the data first\n",
    "    - If the page is grabbing and parsing a data file to build the page, intercept it! (ABI: **A**lways **B**e **I**nspectin' (the network traffic)) [Here's an example](http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/NE/Sarpy/64652/184054/en/summary.html).\n",
    "- Don't DDOS your target page -- pause between multiple HTTP requests\n",
    "- Especially as you're fiddling with your script, save a cached version of each page you're scraping and work with those\n",
    "- Include contact info in your headers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python modules we'll be using\n",
    "- [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) for HTTP requests (fetching a page's contents)\n",
    "- [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for parsing the page's contents into something that Python can work with\n",
    "- [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) for writing the data to a file\n",
    "- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) for pausing between requests"

    "\n",
    "To scrape a web page, you need to _sort of_ understand how a web page is built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web pages are text files, basically, written in something called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML elements are represented (usually) by a pair of tags -- an opening tag and a closing tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "A table, for example, starts with &lt;table> and ends with &lt;/table>. The first tag tells the browser: \"Hey! I got a table here! Render it as a table.\" The closing tag (note the forward slash!) tells the browser: \"Hey! I'm all done with that table, thanks.\" Inside the table are nested more HTML tags representing rows (&lt;tr>) and cells (&lt;td>).\n",
